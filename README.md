# Dicee-game

---

### In this project, we have started to getting introduced to the JavaScript file, we have been using native functions for making work our game.

### It's a very simple game, you just need to refresh the page for knowing if the player one or two wins.

#### For this game we grasp the concepts of: 1) pseudo random numbers, 2) jQuery selectors and 3) flux control by if-else statements.
